*相关句式：*

* *First, two basic model are established for better analysis.* 
* *Fourth, for Task 3, we modify the initial model by taking time into account and generate a 
  new index CICI accordingly.*

摘要总结参考：

- In general, although further improvements are needed, the evaluation system constructed by the thesis provides a relatively comprehensive evaluation plan for the spatial and temporal dynamic assessment of ecosystem service value, thus providing a scientific basis for natural asset assessment and ecological compensation.

（总体而言，虽然还需要进一步完善，但本文构建的评价体系为城市空间和经济发展提供了一个较为全面的评价方案对生态系统服务价值进行时间动态评估，从而为自然资产评估和生态补偿提供科学依据。）

### Assumptions and Notation

#### Assumptions

前言+假设

*可借鉴的前言：Plastic waste disposal is a complex and interdisciplinary problem with international significance. Relevant questions involve subjects like politics, economics, culture, human biology, ecology, geology, and many others. It is impossible to model every possible circumstance. So, we made a couple of assumptions and simplifications, each of which is properly justified.*

*可借鉴的假设：The data we collect from online databases is accurate, reliable and mutually consistent. Because our data sources are all websites of international organizations, it’s reasonable to assume the high quality of their data.*

### Model



### Model evalution

#### Sensitivity analysis

#### Strengths

*相关句式：*

* *The model uses accurate and latest databases to guarantee the reliability of results. The results have high reference value and can be applied in real life immediately. Both of our models quantify levels of plastic waste, making it intuitive to show the results of models.* 

* *The model comprehensively evaluates the level and all the factors selected are objective. Through comprehensive evaluation, our model can output the compellent results. With subjective factors excluded, the model is more stable in the evaluation progress.*

#### Weaknesses and Further Improvement

*相关句式：*

* *Some indicators are missing. To get the index, it requires extra weighting of the indicators, which means the Model can be complex sometimes.*
* *We assume that all the countries or regions will actively cooperate with interventions we put forward. Neglecting those passive countries, there may be some deviations between the practical outcome and that we predicted.*
